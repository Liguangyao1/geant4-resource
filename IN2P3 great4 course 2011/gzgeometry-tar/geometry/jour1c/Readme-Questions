 1 - GEOMETRY

   A space shuttle is modeled by an all-made aluminum cylinder.
   Inside the cabin is a floor, also made out of aluminum.
   The shuttle is placed in space ('World'): the smallest possible box. 
   
   An astronaut is placed on the floor.
    	
	 	
 2 – HOW TO START?
 
  - read the code: day1c.cc (main) and the 2 classes DetectorConstruction
    and PrimaryGeneratorAction
 
  - compile et generate an executable: 
  	% gmake
 		
  - execute day1c in interactive mode with visualization:
	% $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/jour1c
	....
	Idle> type your commands
	....
	Idle> exit
  
		
 3 - PROBLEM: examination of the class DetectorConstruction

    The parameters that determine the geometry (spaceCraftRadius, etc...)
    Are private variables of the class.
    
    Examine the corresponding public accessible functions Get/Set:
    ‘in line’ or separate implementation
    
    Function UpdateGeometry() to force the reconstruction of the geometry 
    
    Function PrintParameters(): print the units
