 1 - GEOMETRY

   A space shuttle is modeled by an all-made aluminum cylinder.
   Inside the cabin is a floor, also made out of aluminum.
   The shuttle is placed in space ('World'): the smallest possible box. 
   
   An astronaut is placed on the floor.

   The reference frame is defined as:
   - x -> red
   - y -> green
   - z -> blue
    	
	 	
 2 – HOW TO START?
 
  - read the code: day1b.cc (main) and the 2 classes DetectorConstruction
    and PrimaryGeneratorAction
 
  - compile and generate an executable: 
  	% gmake
 		
  - execute day1b in interactive mode with visualization:
	% $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/jour1b
	....
	Idle> type your commands
	....
	Idle> exit
  
		
 3 - PROBLEM 

    The parameters that define the geometry
    (cabinRadius, cabinLength, ...etc...)
    Are local variables for the function ConstructVolumes().
    
    Define these variables as private for the DetectorConstruction class.
    Initialize the independent variables in the constructor and leave the 
    calculated variables in the function ConstructVolumes().
    Write the corresponding functions Get/Set public accesible.
    
    Complete the function PrintParameters() to print the units for the
    different geometrical components: World, Spacecraft, Floor, 
    Astronaut.

    Answer: see day1c
