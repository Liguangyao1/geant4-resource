                            ------
	
 1 - GEOMETRY

   A space shuttle is modeled by an all-made aluminum cylinder.
   Inside the cabin is a floor, also made out of aluminum.
   The shuttle is placed in space ('World'): the smallest possible box. 
	 	
 2 – HOW TO START?
 
  - read the code: jour1a.cc (main) and the 2 classes 
    DetectorConstruction and PrimaryGeneratorAction
 
  - compile and generate an executable: 
  	% gmake
 		
  - execute jour1a in interactive mode with visualization:
	% $G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/jour1a
	....
	Idle> type your commands. example:
	
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	Idle> /gun/direction 1 1 0
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	Idle> /gun/position -2.4 0 0 m
	Idle> /run/beamOn 1
	....
	Idle> exit

	 	
 3 - PRACTICE
 	
  - understand what is written on the screen and the drawing.
  - by using the commands /gun/direction and gun/position, try to locate 
    the coordinate system.
  - read the macro vis.mac and try few visualization commands.
  
		
 4 – PROBLEM 1
 
    Model a '(mini)astronaut' with a set of pyramids having a square base 
    (height = 50 cm, base = 60 cm (bottom), 40 cm (top), material = 
    water) and place it on the floor.
    
    - materials: see User's Guide for Application Developer (section 2.3)

	or $G4INSTALL/examples/novice/N03/src/ExN03DetectorConstruction.cc
    - placement with rotation: see placement of the floor
    
    Answer: see day1b
		
 5 - PROBLEM 2
 
    Increase the space and place a second (with rotation ...)
    	
    Answer: see day1b: DetectorConstruction.cc2
